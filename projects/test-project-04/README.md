# test-project-04

Welcome! This project follows the Open Know How (OKH) structure and is
scaffolded for compatibility with the Open Matching Engine (OME).

## Overview

This is an open hardware project that follows the OKH specification for
maximum interoperability and discoverability in the open-source hardware
ecosystem.

## Quick Start

1. **Edit the manifest**: Start with `okh-manifest.json` to define your project
2. **Explore documentation**: Check out the `docs/` directory (MkDocs)
3. **Build docs locally**: Run `mkdocs serve` to preview documentation
4. **Add your content**: Populate the various directories with your files

## Project Structure

This project follows the OKH package structure:

- `design-files/` - CAD models, technical drawings, and design documentation
- `manufacturing-files/` - Assembly guides, compliance documentation
- `bom/` - Bill of Materials in both CSV and Markdown formats
- `making-instructions/` - Step-by-step build and assembly instructions
- `operating-instructions/` - User manuals and maintenance guides
- `quality-instructions/` - QC checklists and testing protocols
- `risk-assessment/` - Safety and risk documentation
- `software/` - Firmware, control software, and related code
- `tool-settings/` - Machine configurations and tool parameters
- `schematics/` - Electrical schematics and circuit diagrams
- `parts/` - Part-specific files organized by component
- `docs/` - Comprehensive documentation using MkDocs

## Development

This project is designed to work seamlessly with the Open Matching Engine.
The OKH manifest (`okh-manifest.json`) contains all metadata needed for
discovery, matching, and manufacturing coordination.
