# Supply Tree Data Structure Requirements

## Overview

The Supply Tree is a data structure that represents complete manufacturing solutions by mapping requirements (defined in OpenKnowHow/OKH) to manufacturing capabilities (defined in OpenKnowWhere/OKW). It captures all possible ways to manufacture a specified quantity of objects, including the facilities, materials, steps, and dependencies involved.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Supply Tree
- Represents a complete manufacturing solution
- Can have multiple branches representing parallel processes
- Has a defined depth (n) representing steps from raw materials to final product
- Must support evaluation and comparison of different solutions
- Should capture both successful paths and alternative routes

### 2. Nodes
Each node in the tree represents a manufacturing stage and must capture:

**Required Properties:**
- Location (reference to OKW facility)
- Input materials/components (with quantities)
- Output materials/components (with quantities)
- Process steps being performed
- Equipment requirements
- Time requirements
- Quality/certification requirements

**Optional Properties:**
- Cost factors
- Energy requirements
- Skill requirements
- Environmental impact factors

### 3. Dependencies
The structure must represent various types of dependencies:

**Process Dependencies:**
- Sequential steps (must happen in order)
- Parallel processes (can happen simultaneously)
- Optional processes
- Alternative processes

**Resource Dependencies:**
- Material requirements
- Equipment requirements
- Facility capabilities
- Human skill requirements

### 4. Metadata Layer
A wrapper around nodes that captures:

**Routing Logic:**
- Alternative paths
- Fallback options
- Retry strategies
- Failure handling

**Quality Metrics:**
- Complexity measures
- Cost factors
- Time efficiency
- Resource utilization
- Environmental impact

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Data Structure Properties

**Must Have:**
- Self-contained (includes all necessary information for manufacturing)
- Traversable (can walk the tree to analyze paths)
- Serializable (can be stored and transmitted)
- Immutable (solutions should be reproducible)

**Should Have:**
- Efficient storage
- Fast traversal
- Easy comparison between trees
- Version control friendly format

### 2. Operations

The structure must support:

**Analysis Operations:**
- Find all possible manufacturing paths
- Calculate total cost/time/resources for a path
- Identify bottlenecks and dependencies
- Compare different solutions
- Validate manufacturing feasibility

**Query Operations:**
- Find nodes by facility
- Find nodes by process type
- Find nodes by material
- Find alternative paths
- Find optimal solutions based on criteria

### 3. Integration Requirements

**Must integrate with:**
- OpenKnowHow (OKH) specification format
- OpenKnowWhere (OKW) specification format
- Standard workflow representations
- Common serialization formats

## Use Cases

### 1. Basic Manufacturing
Example: Simple product assembly from available components
- Depth 0: Final assembly facility
- Depth 1: Component suppliers

### 2. Complex Manufacturing
Example: Custom product requiring component fabrication
- Depth 0: Final assembly
- Depth 1: Component fabrication
- Depth 2: Raw material processing

### 3. Cooking Domain (Test Implementation)
Example: Restaurant meal preparation
- Depth 0: Kitchen preparing the meal
- Depth 1: Ingredient suppliers
- Depth 2: Raw ingredient processors


## Success Criteria

A successful implementation must:

1. Accurately represent all possible manufacturing solutions
2. Support efficient comparison between different solutions
3. Enable easy validation of manufacturing feasibility
4. Scale well with increasing manufacturing complexity
5. Support addition of new metrics and evaluation criteria
6. Maintain clarity and usability for both simple and complex cases

## Next Steps

1. Design core data structures
2. Implement simple version for cooking domain
3. Add metadata layer and routing logic
4. Implement evaluation and comparison methods
5. Add serialization and persistence
6. Develop query and analysis tools
