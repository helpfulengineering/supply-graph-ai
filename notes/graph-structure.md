# Graph Data Model

- **OpenKnowHow:** Technical documentation needed to build a specific piece of hardware.
- **OpenKnowWhere:** Manufacturing facilities and their capabilities.
- **ProcessRequirements:** Specifications defining how raw ingredients must be combined and verified; bridging what needs to be done (OpenKnowHow) with what can be done (OpenKnowWhere).
- **SupplyTree:** A complete manufacturing solution mapping requirements (OpenKnowHow) to capabilities (OpenKnowWhere) through interconnected workflows represented as DAGs.

## The Approach

### Complex Connections
- **Interconnected Entities:**  
  - An OpenKnowHow document may be linked to multiple ProcessRequirements.
  - A ProcessRequirement connects to several manufacturing capabilities within OpenKnowWhere.
- **Expressive Queries:**  
  - A property graph naturally captures these interconnections, enabling complex, many-to-many relationships.

### Network and Supply Chain Modeling
- **Graph Database Strengths:**  
  - Supply chain logistics involve network-like relationships.
  - Graph databases excel at traversing networks and finding optimal paths, crucial for matching technical requirements with manufacturing capabilities.

### Knowledge Graph and AI Integration
- **Unified Data Representation:**  
  - Modeling the data as a graph allows for integrating disparate data sources into a unified Knowledge Graph.
- **Downstream Use Cases:**  
  - Facilitates semantic matching, recommendation engines, and other AI-driven downstream matching layers we discussed.

### Vector Database Integration
- **Optimized Retrieval:**  
  - Graph structures complement vector search by storing and retrieving rich metadata.
- **Dual Approach:**  
  - Structured queries (property graph) combined with vector similarity searches enhances overall performance.

## Graph Data Model Design

### 1. Node Labels and Core Properties

- **OpenKnowHow**
  - **Label:** `OpenKnowHow`
  - **Properties:** `id`, `documentRef`, `license`, `materialSpec`, etc.
  - *Optional:* Break out `DocumentRef`, `License`, and `MaterialSpec` into separate nodes if they require additional relationships.

- **OpenKnowWhere**
  - **Labels:** `Facility`, `Equipment`, `Location`, `Person`
  - **Properties:** Each type can include properties such as `id`, `capabilities`, `locationDetails`, etc.

- **ProcessRequirements**
  - **Label:** `ProcessRequirement`
  - **Properties:** `id`, `processSpecs`, `verificationCriteria`, etc.
  - **Role:** Acts as a bridge linking `OpenKnowHow` nodes to capabilities in `OpenKnowWhere`.

- **SupplyTree**
  - **Labels:** `SupplyTree`, `Workflow`, `WorkflowNode`
  - **Properties:**
    - **SupplyTree:** `id`, `description`
    - **Workflow:** `id`, `order`, etc.
    - **WorkflowNode:** `id`, `stepDescription`, `dependencies`, etc.

### 2. Relationship Types

- **Linking Technical Documents to Process Requirements:**
  - `(OpenKnowHow)-[:DEFINES_REQUIREMENT]->(ProcessRequirement)`

- **Connecting Process Requirements to Manufacturing Capabilities:**
  - `(ProcessRequirement)-[:SUPPORTED_BY]->(Facility)`
  - Similar relationships can be defined for `Equipment`, `Location`, and `Person` nodes as needed.

- **Mapping the SupplyTree:**
  - `(SupplyTree)-[:CONTAINS_WORKFLOW]->(Workflow)`
  - Within a workflow:
    - `(Workflow)-[:HAS_NODE]->(WorkflowNode)`
    - `(WorkflowNode)-[:CONNECTED_TO]->(WorkflowNode)` to form the directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing step dependencies.

### 3. Property Graph Advantages

- **Flexibility:**  
  The schema can evolve with emerging requirements or changes in relationships.

- **Efficient Traversals:**  
  Graph traversal algorithms efficiently execute complex queries, such as finding all facilities that support a given technical document.

- **Metadata-Rich Relationships:**  
  Each relationship can include properties (e.g., `timestamp`, `confidenceScore`, `costMetrics`), adding context for AI-driven matching and analytics.

## Implementation Considerations

### Schema Design
- **Planning:**  
  Start with a comprehensive graph schema diagram that maps nodes, labels, properties, and relationships. This aids in understanding dependencies and planning future integrations.

### Query Examples
- **Sample Cypher Query:**  
  To find all manufacturing facilities supporting a specific technical document:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (doc:OpenKnowHow {id: 'DOC123'})
        -[:DEFINES_REQUIREMENT]->(pr:ProcessRequirement)
        -[:SUPPORTED_BY]->(fac:Facility)
  RETURN fac
  ```

### Integration with Vector Databases
- **Dual Storage:**  
  Plan integration points where vector embeddings can be linked to nodes (either through vector IDs or as embedded properties) to enhance semantic search capabilities.

### Scalability and Performance
- **Growth Management:**  
  Consider graph partitioning or sharding strategies as the network expands, especially if real-time matching and AI processing become computationally intensive.
