# Integration Analysis: OKH and OKW Standards

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Core Data Models

The system needs to handle two primary types of data:

**Requirements (OKH)**
- Project specifications
- Required equipment and processes
- Material requirements
- Skills/capabilities needed
- Batch size requirements

**Capabilities (OKW)** 
- Facility information
- Available equipment
- Supported processes
- Materials worked with
- Certifications and specialties
- Human capacity and skills

### 2. Cooking Domain Model

For the cooking test domain, we can map these concepts:

```
Requirements (Recipe) <-> Capabilities (Kitchen)

Recipe                   Kitchen
- Equipment needed       - Available equipment
- Techniques required    - Supported techniques
- Ingredients needed     - Ingredients available
- Batch size            - Kitchen capacity
- Time requirements     - Operating hours
- Skill level           - Staff skill levels
```

### 3. Standardized Classifications

Both standards emphasize using Wikipedia URLs as canonical references for:
- Equipment types
- Manufacturing/cooking processes
- Materials/ingredients

This provides:
- Consistent terminology
- Clear definitions
- Language independence
- Easy extensibility

### 4. Matching Architecture

The matching system should implement a layered approach:

1. **Basic Compatibility** (Fast filtering)
   - Equipment availability
   - Material compatibility
   - Capacity requirements
   - Location constraints
   
2. **Detailed Matching** (Deeper analysis)
   - Equipment specifications
   - Process capabilities
   - Quality requirements
   - Skill requirements

3. **Advanced Matching** (Fuzzy logic)
   - Equipment substitutions
   - Process alternatives
   - Material substitutions
   - Capability approximations

### 5. Common Data Structures

Key shared structures between standards:

```typescript
interface Location {
    address: Address;
    gpsCoordinates?: Coordinates;
    what3words?: What3Words;
    directions?: string;
}

interface Equipment {
    type: WikipediaReference;
    manufacturer?: string;
    model?: string;
    capabilities: Capability[];
    specifications: Map<string, any>;
}

interface Process {
    type: WikipediaReference;
    parameters: Map<string, any>;
    requirements: Requirement[];
}

interface Material {
    type: WikipediaReference;
    specifications: Map<string, any>;
    supplier?: Agent;
}
```

### 6. Implementation Priorities

1. Create domain-specific extractors for:
   - Recipe requirements
   - Kitchen capabilities
   - Equipment mapping
   - Process mapping

2. Implement basic matching:
   - Equipment availability
   - Process compatibility
   - Material availability
   - Capacity validation

3. Add sophistication:
   - Substitution handling
   - Quality scoring
   - Confidence metrics
   - Ranking algorithms

## Next Steps

1. Design cooking domain extractors
2. Implement basic requirement-capability matching
3. Create test dataset of recipes and kitchens
4. Develop matching algorithms
5. Add substitution handling
6. Build confidence scoring
