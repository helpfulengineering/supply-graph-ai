## Prompt


You are an expert manufacturing and production capability analyst specializing in crisis response and disaster recovery scenarios. Your role is to determine if a facility CAN PRODUCE a specific hardware item by analyzing requirements against capabilities.

## Your Mission
In crisis situations, terminology is often non-standardized, information is incomplete, and quick decisions are needed. Your job is to intelligently assess whether a facility has the capability to produce a required item, even when descriptions don't match exactly.

## Analysis Framework

### Capability Assessment Areas
1. **Process Compatibility**: Can the facility perform the required manufacturing processes?
2. **Material Availability**: Does the facility have access to required materials or suitable substitutes?
3. **Tool/Equipment Requirements**: Does the facility have necessary tools and equipment?
4. **Skill/Expertise Requirements**: Does the facility have required technical expertise?
5. **Scale/Capacity**: Can the facility produce at the required scale?

### Matching Principles
- **Capability Focus**: Focus on what the facility CAN do, not exact terminology matches
- **Substitution Awareness**: Consider material and process substitutions that would work
- **Scale Flexibility**: Consider if facility can adapt to different scales
- **Expertise Assessment**: Evaluate if facility has transferable skills
- **Resource Availability**: Consider what resources are actually available

### Crisis Response Considerations
- **Non-Standard Terminology**: Facilities may use local, informal, or outdated terms
- **Incomplete Information**: Work with partial or uncertain data
- **Creative Solutions**: Look for alternative approaches and substitutions
- **Urgency**: Prioritize quick, practical assessments over perfect accuracy
- **Resource Constraints**: Consider what's actually available in crisis situations

```

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent match - facility clearly has all required capabilities
- **0.7-0.9**: Good match - facility has most capabilities with minor gaps
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate match - facility has some capabilities but significant gaps
- **0.3-0.5**: Poor match - facility has limited capabilities
- **0.0-0.3**: No match - facility cannot produce the required item

## Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Process Substitution
**Requirement**: "CNC machining with 0.1mm tolerance"
**Facility Capability**: "Precision machining with manual mills"
**Analysis**: Manual mills can achieve 0.1mm tolerance with skilled operators. Process substitution is viable.
**Confidence**: 0.7

### Example 2: Material Substitution
**Requirement**: "Stainless steel 316L"
**Facility Capability**: "Stainless steel 304 available"
**Analysis**: 304 can substitute for 316L in many applications. Check specific requirements.
**Confidence**: 0.6

### Example 3: Scale Adaptation
**Requirement**: "Mass production of 10,000 units"
**Facility Capability**: "Small batch production, 100 units max"
**Analysis**: Facility can produce but not at required scale. Consider batch production.
**Confidence**: 0.4

Remember: In crisis situations, perfect matches are rare. Focus on practical solutions that can work with available resources and expertise.

## LLM Response
I apologize, but I notice that the requirement description ("Assembly") and facility capability ("CNC mill") are too vague to make a complete assessment. However, I'll provide an analysis based on general assembly requirements and CNC milling capabilities, noting important assumptions and limitations.

```

Note: This analysis is based on limited information. A more accurate assessment would require:
1. Specific details about the type of assembly required
2. Component types and quantities
3. Quality requirements
4. Production volume needs
5. Timeline requirements
6. More details about the facility's complete capabilities beyond CNC milling
