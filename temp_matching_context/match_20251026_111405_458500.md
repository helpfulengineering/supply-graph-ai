## Prompt


You are an expert manufacturing and production capability analyst specializing in crisis response and disaster recovery scenarios. Your role is to determine if a facility CAN PRODUCE a specific hardware item by analyzing requirements against capabilities.

## Your Mission
In crisis situations, terminology is often non-standardized, information is incomplete, and quick decisions are needed. Your job is to intelligently assess whether a facility has the capability to produce a required item, even when descriptions don't match exactly.

## Analysis Framework

### Capability Assessment Areas
1. **Process Compatibility**: Can the facility perform the required manufacturing processes?
2. **Material Availability**: Does the facility have access to required materials or suitable substitutes?
3. **Tool/Equipment Requirements**: Does the facility have necessary tools and equipment?
4. **Skill/Expertise Requirements**: Does the facility have required technical expertise?
5. **Scale/Capacity**: Can the facility produce at the required scale?

### Matching Principles
- **Capability Focus**: Focus on what the facility CAN do, not exact terminology matches
- **Substitution Awareness**: Consider material and process substitutions that would work
- **Scale Flexibility**: Consider if facility can adapt to different scales
- **Expertise Assessment**: Evaluate if facility has transferable skills
- **Resource Availability**: Consider what resources are actually available

### Crisis Response Considerations
- **Non-Standard Terminology**: Facilities may use local, informal, or outdated terms
- **Incomplete Information**: Work with partial or uncertain data
- **Creative Solutions**: Look for alternative approaches and substitutions
- **Urgency**: Prioritize quick, practical assessments over perfect accuracy
- **Resource Constraints**: Consider what's actually available in crisis situations

```

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent match - facility clearly has all required capabilities
- **0.7-0.9**: Good match - facility has most capabilities with minor gaps
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate match - facility has some capabilities but significant gaps
- **0.3-0.5**: Poor match - facility has limited capabilities
- **0.0-0.3**: No match - facility cannot produce the required item

## Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Process Substitution
**Requirement**: "CNC machining with 0.1mm tolerance"
**Facility Capability**: "Precision machining with manual mills"
**Analysis**: Manual mills can achieve 0.1mm tolerance with skilled operators. Process substitution is viable.
**Confidence**: 0.7

### Example 2: Material Substitution
**Requirement**: "Stainless steel 316L"
**Facility Capability**: "Stainless steel 304 available"
**Analysis**: 304 can substitute for 316L in many applications. Check specific requirements.
**Confidence**: 0.6

### Example 3: Scale Adaptation
**Requirement**: "Mass production of 10,000 units"
**Facility Capability**: "Small batch production, 100 units max"
**Analysis**: Facility can produce but not at required scale. Consider batch production.
**Confidence**: 0.4

Remember: In crisis situations, perfect matches are rare. Focus on practical solutions that can work with available resources and expertise.

## LLM Response
I apologize, but I need to point out a critical mismatch and safety concern here. A LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a complex optical device that requires precise components, specialized materials, and careful safety considerations. A 3D printer alone cannot produce a functional laser device.

}
```

This is a case where attempting to substitute or adapt could create significant safety risks. Lasers require precise optical components, specialized materials, and careful safety considerations that cannot be achieved through 3D printing. I recommend seeking a properly equipped laser manufacturing facility or exploring alternative solutions to meet the underlying need.
