## Prompt


You are an expert manufacturing and production capability analyst specializing in crisis response and disaster recovery scenarios. Your role is to determine if a facility CAN PRODUCE a specific hardware item by analyzing requirements against capabilities.

## Your Mission
In crisis situations, terminology is often non-standardized, information is incomplete, and quick decisions are needed. Your job is to intelligently assess whether a facility has the capability to produce a required item, even when descriptions don't match exactly.

## Analysis Framework

### Capability Assessment Areas
1. **Process Compatibility**: Can the facility perform the required manufacturing processes?
2. **Material Availability**: Does the facility have access to required materials or suitable substitutes?
3. **Tool/Equipment Requirements**: Does the facility have necessary tools and equipment?
4. **Skill/Expertise Requirements**: Does the facility have required technical expertise?
5. **Scale/Capacity**: Can the facility produce at the required scale?

### Matching Principles
- **Capability Focus**: Focus on what the facility CAN do, not exact terminology matches
- **Substitution Awareness**: Consider material and process substitutions that would work
- **Scale Flexibility**: Consider if facility can adapt to different scales
- **Expertise Assessment**: Evaluate if facility has transferable skills
- **Resource Availability**: Consider what resources are actually available

### Crisis Response Considerations
- **Non-Standard Terminology**: Facilities may use local, informal, or outdated terms
- **Incomplete Information**: Work with partial or uncertain data
- **Creative Solutions**: Look for alternative approaches and substitutions
- **Urgency**: Prioritize quick, practical assessments over perfect accuracy
- **Resource Constraints**: Consider what's actually available in crisis situations

```

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent match - facility clearly has all required capabilities
- **0.7-0.9**: Good match - facility has most capabilities with minor gaps
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate match - facility has some capabilities but significant gaps
- **0.3-0.5**: Poor match - facility has limited capabilities
- **0.0-0.3**: No match - facility cannot produce the required item

## Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Process Substitution
**Requirement**: "CNC machining with 0.1mm tolerance"
**Facility Capability**: "Precision machining with manual mills"
**Analysis**: Manual mills can achieve 0.1mm tolerance with skilled operators. Process substitution is viable.
**Confidence**: 0.7

### Example 2: Material Substitution
**Requirement**: "Stainless steel 316L"
**Facility Capability**: "Stainless steel 304 available"
**Analysis**: 304 can substitute for 316L in many applications. Check specific requirements.
**Confidence**: 0.6

### Example 3: Scale Adaptation
**Requirement**: "Mass production of 10,000 units"
**Facility Capability**: "Small batch production, 100 units max"
**Analysis**: Facility can produce but not at required scale. Consider batch production.
**Confidence**: 0.4

Remember: In crisis situations, perfect matches are rare. Focus on practical solutions that can work with available resources and expertise.

## LLM Response
I'll analyze the match between "CNC" requirement and "Computer numerical control" facility capability.

```json

    "process_compatibility": {
      "score": 1.0,
      "analysis": "Perfect match - CNC and Computer numerical control are exactly the same technology, just using different terminology. One is the acronym, other is the full term.",
      "substitutions": ["Not needed - direct capability match"]
    },
    "material_availability": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "analysis": "CNC machines typically work with a wide range of materials. Since facility has CNC capability, they likely maintain standard material inventory.",
      "substitutions": ["Multiple material options available depending on specific part requirements"]
    },
    "tool_equipment": {
      "score": 1.0,
      "analysis": "Facility explicitly has CNC equipment, which is exactly what's required",
      "adaptations": ["No adaptations needed - direct equipment match"]
    },
    "expertise_skills": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "analysis": "Facility operating CNC equipment implies trained CNC operators and programmers",
      "training_needs": ["Possibly G-code programming for specific parts", "Setup and fixturing for new products"]
    },
    "scale_capacity": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "analysis": "CNC machines are flexible in terms of production scale, can handle both small and large batches",
      "scaling_options": [
        "Multiple shift operation",
        "Batch processing",
        "Program optimization for efficiency"
      ]
    }
  },
  "overall_analysis": "This is a direct match - CNC and Computer numerical control are the same technology, with one being the acronym of the other. The facility has exactly the capability required.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Direct terminology match between requirement and capability",
    "Facility has actual CNC equipment",
    "Implied presence of skilled CNC operators"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Proceed with production planning",
    "Verify specific CNC machine specifications against part requirements",
    "Review available material stock",
    "Check operator availability for required production schedule"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Specific part requirements might exceed machine capabilities",
    "Material availability in crisis situation",
    "Potential maintenance/repair delays during crisis"
  ],
  "crisis_adaptability": "High adaptability - CNC machines are versatile and can be quickly reprogrammed for different parts. Digital nature of CNC allows for remote programming if needed during crisis."
}
```

This is a clear case of identical capability with different terminology (acronym vs. full term). The high confidence score (0.95) reflects this direct match. The facility can definitely produce CNC work, as they explicitly have Computer Numerical Control capability. The only minor uncertainties relate to specific part requirements and crisis-related resource availability, but the basic capability match is extremely strong.
