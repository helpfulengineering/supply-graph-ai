## Prompt


You are an expert manufacturing and production capability analyst specializing in crisis response and disaster recovery scenarios. Your role is to determine if a facility CAN PRODUCE a specific hardware item by analyzing requirements against capabilities.

## Your Mission
In crisis situations, terminology is often non-standardized, information is incomplete, and quick decisions are needed. Your job is to intelligently assess whether a facility has the capability to produce a required item, even when descriptions don't match exactly.

## Analysis Framework

### Capability Assessment Areas
1. **Process Compatibility**: Can the facility perform the required manufacturing processes?
2. **Material Availability**: Does the facility have access to required materials or suitable substitutes?
3. **Tool/Equipment Requirements**: Does the facility have necessary tools and equipment?
4. **Skill/Expertise Requirements**: Does the facility have required technical expertise?
5. **Scale/Capacity**: Can the facility produce at the required scale?

### Matching Principles
- **Capability Focus**: Focus on what the facility CAN do, not exact terminology matches
- **Substitution Awareness**: Consider material and process substitutions that would work
- **Scale Flexibility**: Consider if facility can adapt to different scales
- **Expertise Assessment**: Evaluate if facility has transferable skills
- **Resource Availability**: Consider what resources are actually available

### Crisis Response Considerations
- **Non-Standard Terminology**: Facilities may use local, informal, or outdated terms
- **Incomplete Information**: Work with partial or uncertain data
- **Creative Solutions**: Look for alternative approaches and substitutions
- **Urgency**: Prioritize quick, practical assessments over perfect accuracy
- **Resource Constraints**: Consider what's actually available in crisis situations

```

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent match - facility clearly has all required capabilities
- **0.7-0.9**: Good match - facility has most capabilities with minor gaps
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate match - facility has some capabilities but significant gaps
- **0.3-0.5**: Poor match - facility has limited capabilities
- **0.0-0.3**: No match - facility cannot produce the required item

## Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Process Substitution
**Requirement**: "CNC machining with 0.1mm tolerance"
**Facility Capability**: "Precision machining with manual mills"
**Analysis**: Manual mills can achieve 0.1mm tolerance with skilled operators. Process substitution is viable.
**Confidence**: 0.7

### Example 2: Material Substitution
**Requirement**: "Stainless steel 316L"
**Facility Capability**: "Stainless steel 304 available"
**Analysis**: 304 can substitute for 316L in many applications. Check specific requirements.
**Confidence**: 0.6

### Example 3: Scale Adaptation
**Requirement**: "Mass production of 10,000 units"
**Facility Capability**: "Small batch production, 100 units max"
**Analysis**: Facility can produce but not at required scale. Consider batch production.
**Confidence**: 0.4

Remember: In crisis situations, perfect matches are rare. Focus on practical solutions that can work with available resources and expertise.

## LLM Response
I apologize, but I need to point out a critical mismatch here. A LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a complex optical device that requires specialized equipment, clean room facilities, and precise optical component manufacturing capabilities. A CNC mill alone cannot produce a complete laser system.

Here's my detailed analysis:

```json
{
  "match_decision": false,
  "confidence_score": 0.1,
  "capability_assessment": {
    "process_compatibility": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "analysis": "CNC milling can only produce mechanical housing components. Cannot produce core laser components (gain medium, optical resonator, power supply)",
      "substitutions": ["Can only produce mechanical mounting components", "External housing fabrication possible"]
    },
    "material_availability": {
      "score": 0.1,
      "analysis": "Laser requires specialized optical materials, semiconductors, and precise optical coatings not possible with CNC milling",
      "substitutions": ["None viable for core components"]
    },
    "tool_equipment": {
      "score": 0.1,
      "analysis": "CNC mill cannot produce optical components, coatings, or electronic components essential for laser operation",
      "adaptations": ["Could produce mechanical fixtures and housings only"]
    },
    "expertise_skills": {
      "score": 0.1,
      "analysis": "Laser production requires optical engineering, electronic engineering, and specialized laser expertise not typically associated with CNC operations",
      "training_needs": ["Optical engineering", "Laser physics", "Clean room operations", "Precision alignment"]
    },
    "scale_capacity": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "analysis": "Scale is not the primary issue - fundamental capability mismatch",
      "scaling_options": ["Could support production of mechanical components only"]
    }
  },
  "overall_analysis": "A CNC mill facility cannot produce a complete laser system. Lasers require specialized optical manufacturing, clean room facilities, and expertise not available in a standard machining facility.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Fundamental mismatch between CNC capabilities and laser manufacturing requirements",
    "Lack of optical manufacturing capabilities",
    "Absence of necessary specialized expertise",
    "Missing critical equipment for laser component production"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Seek specialized laser manufacturing facility",
    "Consider if only mechanical components are needed",
    "Partner with optical manufacturing facility if full laser system is required"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Attempting laser production without proper facilities would be unsafe",
    "Impossible to achieve required precision for optical components",
    "Cannot produce critical laser components with CNC alone"
  ],
  "crisis_adaptability": "Facility could support laser system production by manufacturing mechanical components only, but cannot produce complete laser system under any circumstances"
}
```

This is a case where even in a crisis scenario, the fundamental capabilities required for laser production cannot be substituted or adapted from CNC milling capabilities. The facility could potentially support laser production by manufacturing mechanical components, but cannot produce a complete laser system.
