## Prompt


You are an expert manufacturing and production capability analyst specializing in crisis response and disaster recovery scenarios. Your role is to determine if a facility CAN PRODUCE a specific hardware item by analyzing requirements against capabilities.

## Your Mission
In crisis situations, terminology is often non-standardized, information is incomplete, and quick decisions are needed. Your job is to intelligently assess whether a facility has the capability to produce a required item, even when descriptions don't match exactly.

## Analysis Framework

### Capability Assessment Areas
1. **Process Compatibility**: Can the facility perform the required manufacturing processes?
2. **Material Availability**: Does the facility have access to required materials or suitable substitutes?
3. **Tool/Equipment Requirements**: Does the facility have necessary tools and equipment?
4. **Skill/Expertise Requirements**: Does the facility have required technical expertise?
5. **Scale/Capacity**: Can the facility produce at the required scale?

### Matching Principles
- **Capability Focus**: Focus on what the facility CAN do, not exact terminology matches
- **Substitution Awareness**: Consider material and process substitutions that would work
- **Scale Flexibility**: Consider if facility can adapt to different scales
- **Expertise Assessment**: Evaluate if facility has transferable skills
- **Resource Availability**: Consider what resources are actually available

### Crisis Response Considerations
- **Non-Standard Terminology**: Facilities may use local, informal, or outdated terms
- **Incomplete Information**: Work with partial or uncertain data
- **Creative Solutions**: Look for alternative approaches and substitutions
- **Urgency**: Prioritize quick, practical assessments over perfect accuracy
- **Resource Constraints**: Consider what's actually available in crisis situations

```

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent match - facility clearly has all required capabilities
- **0.7-0.9**: Good match - facility has most capabilities with minor gaps
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate match - facility has some capabilities but significant gaps
- **0.3-0.5**: Poor match - facility has limited capabilities
- **0.0-0.3**: No match - facility cannot produce the required item

## Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Process Substitution
**Requirement**: "CNC machining with 0.1mm tolerance"
**Facility Capability**: "Precision machining with manual mills"
**Analysis**: Manual mills can achieve 0.1mm tolerance with skilled operators. Process substitution is viable.
**Confidence**: 0.7

### Example 2: Material Substitution
**Requirement**: "Stainless steel 316L"
**Facility Capability**: "Stainless steel 304 available"
**Analysis**: 304 can substitute for 316L in many applications. Check specific requirements.
**Confidence**: 0.6

### Example 3: Scale Adaptation
**Requirement**: "Mass production of 10,000 units"
**Facility Capability**: "Small batch production, 100 units max"
**Analysis**: Facility can produce but not at required scale. Consider batch production.
**Confidence**: 0.4

Remember: In crisis situations, perfect matches are rare. Focus on practical solutions that can work with available resources and expertise.

## LLM Response
I apologize, but I need to point out a critical mismatch here. A LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a complex optical device that requires very specific components, precise alignment, and specialized manufacturing capabilities. A 3D printer alone cannot produce a functional laser device. Here's my detailed analysis:

```json
{
  "match_decision": false,
  "confidence_score": 0.1,
  "capability_assessment": {
    "process_compatibility": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "analysis": "3D printing can only produce basic housings or structural components, but cannot create critical laser components like gain medium, optical resonators, or precision mirrors",
      "substitutions": ["Can only produce non-functional mock-ups or housings"]
    },
    "material_availability": {
      "score": 0.1,
      "analysis": "3D printing materials (typically plastics or resins) are fundamentally unsuitable for most laser components which require specialized optical materials",
      "substitutions": ["None viable for core laser components"]
    },
    "tool_equipment": {
      "score": 0.1,
      "analysis": "3D printer lacks capability for optical component manufacturing, coating, alignment, and testing required for laser production",
      "adaptations": ["Limited to producing auxiliary components only"]
    },
    "expertise_skills": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "analysis": "Laser manufacturing requires specialized optical engineering expertise not typically associated with 3D printing operations",
      "training_needs": [
        "Optical engineering expertise",
        "Laser physics knowledge",
        "Precision alignment skills",
        "Quality control for optical components"
      ]
    },
    "scale_capacity": {
      "score": 0.1,
      "analysis": "Scale is not the primary issue; fundamental capability mismatch exists",
      "scaling_options": ["Not applicable due to fundamental capability mismatch"]
    }
  },
  "overall_analysis": "A 3D printer facility cannot produce a functional laser device. Lasers require specialized optical manufacturing capabilities, precise alignment equipment, and specific materials that are beyond the scope of 3D printing technology.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Fundamental mismatch between 3D printing capabilities and laser manufacturing requirements",
    "Lack of optical component manufacturing capability",
    "Absence of specialized materials and expertise",
    "Missing critical testing and alignment equipment"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Seek specialized laser manufacturing facility",
    "Consider sourcing completed laser units instead of manufacturing",
    "Could potentially produce only non-critical housing components",
    "Partner with optical manufacturing facility if laser production is essential"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Cannot produce functional laser components",
    "Safety risks if attempting to produce laser components without proper capabilities",
    "Quality and reliability issues",
    "Regulatory compliance concerns"
  ],
  "crisis_adaptability": "Even in crisis conditions, a 3D printing facility cannot be adapted to produce functional laser devices due to fundamental technological limitations"
}
```

This is a case where the technological gap between the requirement (LASER) and the available capability (3D printer) is too fundamental to bridge, even in crisis conditions. While 3D printing is versatile for many applications, laser manufacturing requires specialized optical manufacturing capabilities that cannot be substituted or approximated with 3D printing technology.
