# The optional site layer

OHM is software you run yourself. The hosted instance is a convenience, not the
product — so the whole *site* layer is a capability each instance opts into,
and it defaults to **off**.

This follows the same idiom as [`OHM_SECURITY_MODE`](security-modes.md): a
posture selected by environment variable, read through config, never
hard-coded.

## Off is a first-class state

With no Supabase configured, an instance is **not degraded**. It is the default
deployment:

- theme and mode preferences live on the device
- there is no visitor gate
- no telemetry is collected or sent
- `/mission-control` returns a real 404, and no nav entry advertises it
- the Supabase SDK is code-split into a lazy chunk the browser never fetches

"Configure Supabase" must never appear as an error or an empty panel. The
capability simply does not exist on that instance, and the UI reads as
intentional.

## Two vocabularies, deliberately named apart

This is the boundary the layer must not cross:

| Concern | Source of truth | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| **Application authorization** — API keys, DIDs, capability grants, `isAdmin`, `RequireAdmin`, the ten Settings panels | Backend `whoami` (unchanged) | What you may **do** in OHM |
| **Site layer** — visitor gate, telemetry, whitelabel, Mission Control | Optional Supabase `ohmgr_*` | Who visited the **site**, and how it looks |

Surfaced as **`isAdmin`** (application) and **`isOperator`** (site). Never
merged, never aliased.

This is not tidiness. OHM's [identity model](identity-model.md) promises
offline verification with no central authority; a second source of `isAdmin`
would make `RequireAdmin` and the Settings tab list obey two disagreeing
truths, and would put a network dependency inside an authorization path that
is specified to work without one.

## Enabling it

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run [`supabase/schema.sql`](../../supabase/schema.sql) in its SQL editor.
   It is idempotent and safe to re-run.
3. Set the operator token and grant `is_admin`, both from the SQL editor —
   neither is reachable from a client.
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_OHM_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_OHM_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   and rebuild. These are `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because the anon key is public by
   design: it can only call whitelisted `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs.

The schema is prefixed `ohmgr_` rather than `ohm_` because the sibling
openhardwaremonitor project owns `ohm_` in the shared database.

## Verifying both directions

The suite is expected to pass with the layer **off** (the default) and **on**.
`e2e/site-layer.spec.ts` covers the off direction on every CI run: no nav
entry, a 404 for the route, no site-layer console errors, and theme/mode still
working with no backend at all.
