# Capability Matcher System Documentation

## Overview

The Capability Matcher is a modular system designed to match requirements with capabilities across different domains. It provides a framework for parsing domain-specific requirements and matching them against available capabilities, while supporting learning and evolution over time.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Domain Independence**
   - Core system is domain-agnostic
   - Domain-specific logic is encapsulated in modules
   - Common patterns are abstracted into reusable components

2. **Deterministic Base with Learning Extensions**
   - Core matching uses deterministic rules and patterns
   - Learning components augment but don't replace base logic
   - System maintains provenance of learned rules

3. **Modular Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Pluggable components
   - Extensible design

4. **Progressive Knowledge Enhancement**
   - Base rules provide initial functionality
   - System learns from usage and feedback
   - External knowledge sources can be integrated
   - User-provided rules and context are supported

## Key Workflows

### 1. Materials to Possible Designs
Match available materials to potential designs/recipes

**Input:**

- Current capacity/availability

### 3. Production Capacity Analysis
Analyze and rank facilities by production capability

**Input:**
- Design specification
- List of facilities
- Production requirements

**Output:**
- Ranked facility list
- Capacity estimates
- Confidence scores

**Considerations:**
- Equipment capabilities
- Facility size/type
- Staff expertise
- Current utilization

### 4. Facility Gap Analysis
Identify required changes to enable production

**Input:**
- Design requirements
- Facility capabilities
- Optional constraints

**Output:**
- Required additions/changes
- Alternative approaches
- Cost/effort estimates

**Considerations:**
- Minimal required changes
- Alternative solutions
- Dependencies
- Implementation feasibility

## Core Components

### Material Knowledge Management

```python
class MaterialKnowledge:
    """
    Manages hierarchical knowledge about material properties and substitutions
    
    Layers:
    1. Base Rules - Built-in, verified substitutions
    2. Learned Rules - Derived from usage patterns
    3. User Rules - Explicitly provided
    4. Temporary Rules - Context-specific
    """

class SubstitutionFeedback:
    """
    Tracks and analyzes outcomes of material substitutions
    """

class KnowledgeIntegrator:
    """
    Manages integration of external knowledge sources
    """
```

### Matching Engine

```python
class ContextualMatcher:
    """
    Handles context-aware matching of requirements to capabilities
    """

class GeographicMatcher:
    """
    Manages location-based facility matching
    """

class CapacityAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyzes and estimates production capacities
    """
```

## Knowledge Evolution

### Learning Mechanism
1. **Base Knowledge**
   - Pre-defined rules and patterns
   - Verified relationships
   - Domain constraints

2. **Usage Learning**
   - Track successful/failed matches
   - Record substitution outcomes
   - Analyze usage patterns

3. **External Integration**
   - Import knowledge from external sources
   - Validate against existing rules
   - Resolve conflicts

4. **Context Handling**
   - Apply temporary rules
   - Consider user preferences
   - Handle domain-specific constraints

### Knowledge Sources
1. **Internal**
   - Built-in rules
   - Usage patterns
   - Feedback analysis

2. **External**
   - User-provided rules
   - Domain databases
   - Expert knowledge

3. **Contextual**
   - Session-specific rules
   - Temporary constraints
   - User preferences
