# SupplyTree Model Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the migration from the complex workflow-based SupplyTree model to the simplified SupplyTree model optimized for the core matching use case. This migration provides significant performance improvements while maintaining backward compatibility through feature flags.

## What Changed

### Before: Complex Workflow-Based Model

The original SupplyTree model included:
- **Workflow DAGs**: Complex Directed Acyclic Graphs with NetworkX
- **Workflow Nodes**: Individual manufacturing steps with dependencies
- **Workflow Connections**: Relationships between workflows
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Complex validation logic
- **Resource Snapshots**: Point-in-time data storage
- **Complex Serialization**: Large, nested data structures

### After: Simplified Matching-Focused Model

The new simplified SupplyTree model includes:
- **Direct Facility Mapping**: One facility per supply tree
- **Capability Matching**: Direct mapping of requirements to capabilities
- **Material Tracking**: Simple list of required materials
- **Process Identification**: Clear identification of manufacturing processes
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quantitative assessment of match quality
- **Set Operations**: Efficient deduplication and uniqueness

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Removed Classes

The following classes have been completely removed:

```python
# REMOVED - No longer available
class WorkflowNode:
    pass

class Workflow:
    pass

class WorkflowConnection:
    pass

class CircularDependencyError:
    pass
```

### 2. Simplified SupplyTree Model

The SupplyTree class has been completely redesigned:

#### Before (Complex Model)
```python
@dataclass
class SupplyTree:
    id: UUID
    workflows: Dict[UUID, Workflow]  # Complex workflow DAGs
    connections: List[WorkflowConnection]  # Workflow relationships
    snapshots: Dict[str, ResourceSnapshot]  # Point-in-time data
    creation_time: datetime
    okh_reference: Optional[str]
    required_quantity: int
    deadline: Optional[timedelta]
    metadata: Dict
```

#### After (Simplified Model)
```python
@dataclass
class SupplyTree:
    id: UUID
    facility_id: UUID  # Direct facility mapping
    facility_name: str
    okh_reference: str
    confidence_score: float
    estimated_cost: Optional[float] = None
    estimated_time: Optional[str] = None
    materials_required: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    capabilities_used: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    match_type: str = "unknown"  # "direct", "heuristic", "nlp", "llm"
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### 3. Changed Return Types

#### MatchingService
```python
# Before
async def find_matches_with_manifest(...) -> List[SupplyTreeSolution]

# After
async def find_matches_with_manifest(...) -> Set[SupplyTreeSolution]
```

#### API Responses
```python
# Before
class MatchResponse:
    solutions: List[dict]  # List of complex workflow data

# After
class MatchResponse:
    solutions: List[dict]  # List of simplified supply tree data
```

### 4. Removed Methods

The following methods are no longer available:

```python
# REMOVED - No longer available
supply_tree.add_workflow(workflow)
supply_tree.connect_workflows(connection)
supply_tree.add_snapshot(uri, content)
supply_tree.validate_against_okh(okh_manifest)
supply_tree.validate_against_okw(facilities)
supply_tree.validate_snapshot()
supply_tree.calculate_confidence()
```

## Migration Path

### 1. Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility through the `include_workflows` feature flag:

```python
# API Request
{
    "okh_manifest": {...},
    "include_workflows": false  # Default: simplified model
}

# For legacy clients that need workflows
{
    "okh_manifest": {...},
    "include_workflows": true   # Legacy: complex model (if available)
}
```

### 2. Code Migration

#### Creating Supply Trees

**Before:**
```python
# Complex workflow creation
supply_tree = SupplyTree()
workflow = Workflow(name="Manufacturing Process")

milling_node = WorkflowNode(
    name="Mill Housing",
    okh_refs=[ResourceURI(...)],
    input_requirements={"material": "aluminum"},
    output_specifications={"tolerance": "0.1mm"}
)

workflow.add_node(milling_node)
supply_tree.add_workflow(workflow)
```

**After:**
```python
# Simplified factory method
supply_tree = SupplyTree.from_facility_and_manifest(
    facility=manufacturing_facility,
    manifest=okh_manifest,
    confidence=0.85
)
```

#### Working with Results

**Before:**
```python
# Complex workflow navigation
for workflow in supply_tree.workflows.values():
    for node_id in workflow.graph.nodes:
        node = workflow.graph.nodes[node_id]['data']
        if node.process_status == ProcessStatus.COMPLETED:
            # Process completed node
            pass
```

**After:**
```python
# Direct access to facility information
print(f"Facility: {supply_tree.facility_name}")
print(f"Confidence: {supply_tree.confidence_score}")
print(f"Materials: {supply_tree.materials_required}")
print(f"Capabilities: {supply_tree.capabilities_used}")
```

#### Set Operations

**Before:**
```python
# Manual deduplication
unique_solutions = []
seen_facilities = set()
for solution in solutions:
    if solution.tree.facility_id not in seen_facilities:
        unique_solutions.append(solution)
        seen_facilities.add(solution.tree.facility_id)
```

**After:**
```python
# Automatic deduplication with Set operations
unique_solutions = set(solutions)  # Automatic deduplication by facility_id
```

### 3. API Migration

#### Request Changes

**Before:**
```python
# Complex request with workflow options
{
    "okh_manifest": {...},
    "include_workflows": true,
    "workflow_options": {
        "validate_dependencies": true,
        "check_circular_deps": true
    }
}
```

**After:**
```python
# Simplified request
{
    "okh_manifest": {...},
    "min_confidence": 0.8,
    "max_results": 10,
    "access_type": "public",
    "facility_status": "active"
}
```

#### Response Changes

**Before:**
```python
# Complex response with workflow data
{
    "solutions": [
        {
            "id": "uuid",
            "workflows": {
                "workflow-id": {
                    "graph": {...},  # Complex NetworkX graph
                    "entry_points": [...],
                    "exit_points": [...]
                }
            },
            "connections": [...],
            "snapshots": {...}
        }
    ]
}
```

**After:**
```python
# Simplified response
{
    "solutions": [
        {
            "id": "uuid",
            "facility_id": "uuid",
            "facility_name": "Manufacturing Co.",
            "okh_reference": "Design Name",
            "confidence_score": 0.85,
            "estimated_cost": 1500.0,
            "estimated_time": "3 days",
            "materials_required": ["aluminum", "steel"],
            "capabilities_used": ["milling", "drilling"],
            "match_type": "direct"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Testing Migration

### 1. Unit Tests

Update your unit tests to use the simplified model:

```python
# Before
def test_supply_tree_creation():
    supply_tree = SupplyTree()
    workflow = Workflow(name="Test Workflow")
    # ... complex workflow setup
    assert len(supply_tree.workflows) == 1

# After
def test_supply_tree_creation():
    supply_tree = SupplyTree.from_facility_and_manifest(
        facility=test_facility,
        manifest=test_manifest,
        confidence=0.8
    )
    assert supply_tree.facility_id == test_facility.id
    assert supply_tree.confidence_score == 0.8
```

### 2. Integration Tests

Update integration tests to use the simplified model:

```python
# Before
def test_matching_integration():
    results = await matching_service.find_matches_with_manifest(...)
    assert isinstance(results, list)
    for result in results:
        assert len(result.tree.workflows) > 0

# After
def test_matching_integration():
    results = await matching_service.find_matches_with_manifest(...)
    assert isinstance(results, set)  # Now returns Set
    for result in results:
        assert result.tree.facility_id is not None
        assert result.tree.confidence_score > 0
```

### 3. API Tests

Update API tests to expect simplified responses:

```python
# Before
def test_api_response():
    response = await client.post("/api/v1/match", json=request_data)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "workflows" in data["solutions"][0]

# After
def test_api_response():
    response = await client.post("/api/v1/match", json=request_data)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "facility_id" in data["solutions"][0]
    assert "confidence_score" in data["solutions"][0]
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Import Errors

**Issue:** Importing removed classes
```python
# ERROR - These classes no longer exist
from src.core.models.supply_trees import Workflow, WorkflowNode
```

**Solution:** Update imports to use simplified model
```python
# CORRECT - Use simplified model
from src.core.models.supply_trees import SupplyTree, SupplyTreeSolution
```

### 2. Method Not Found

**Issue:** Calling removed methods
```python
# ERROR - These methods no longer exist
supply_tree.add_workflow(workflow)
supply_tree.validate_against_okh(manifest)
```

**Solution:** Use new factory method
```python
# CORRECT - Use factory method
supply_tree = SupplyTree.from_facility_and_manifest(facility, manifest)
```

### 3. Type Errors

**Issue:** Expecting List instead of Set
```python
# ERROR - Now returns Set, not List
results: List[SupplyTreeSolution] = await matching_service.find_matches_with_manifest(...)
```

**Solution:** Update type annotations
```python
# CORRECT - Now returns Set
results: Set[SupplyTreeSolution] = await matching_service.find_matches_with_manifest(...)
```

### 4. Serialization Issues

**Issue:** Complex serialization failing
```python
# ERROR - Complex workflow data can't be serialized
json.dumps(supply_tree.to_dict())
```

**Solution:** Use simplified serialization
```python
# CORRECT - Simplified data serializes easily
json.dumps(supply_tree.to_dict())
```

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to the old model:

### 1. Feature Flag

Set the `include_workflows` flag to `true` in API requests:

```python
{
    "okh_manifest": {...},
    "include_workflows": true  # Use legacy complex model
}
```

### 2. Code Rollback

If you have a backup of the old code:

1. Restore the old `supply_trees.py` file
2. Restore the old `matching_service.py` file
3. Update imports to use the old model
4. Run tests to ensure compatibility

### 3. Data Migration

If you have stored SupplyTree data:

1. **Backup existing data** before migration
2. **Test migration scripts** on sample data
3. **Validate migrated data** against original
4. **Keep backup** until migration is verified
