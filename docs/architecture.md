# Capability Matcher Architecture

## Overview

The Capability Matcher is designed as a modular system that separates core matching logic from domain-specific implementations. This allows for consistent matching behavior while accommodating the unique requirements and constraints of different domains.

## Core Components

### Base Classes and Interfaces

The system is built around several key abstractions:

```python
Requirement:
- Represents what is needed (e.g., equipment, processes)
- Contains parameters and constraints

Capability:
- Represents what is available
- Contains parameters and limitations

DomainParser:
- Converts domain-specific input into standardized requirements
- Handles taxonomy mapping and validation

CapabilityMatcher:
- Implements matching logic
- Produces scored matches between requirements and capabilities
```

### Core Services

1. **Pattern Matching Engine**
   - Regular expression based matching
   - Token pattern matching
   - Fuzzy matching capabilities

2. **Validation Framework**
   - Input validation
   - Constraint checking
   - Data consistency verification

3. **Scoring System**
   - Configurable scoring algorithms
   - Weighting mechanisms
   - Confidence calculations

## Domain-Specific Implementation

Each domain implementation consists of:

1. **Parser**
   - Converts domain input into standardized format
   - Maps domain-specific terms to standard taxonomy
   - Extracts parameters and constraints

2. **Matcher**
   - Implements domain-specific matching rules
   - Handles special cases and requirements
   - Applies domain-specific scoring

3. **Taxonomies**
   - Standard terminology
   - Hierarchical relationships
   - Term mappings

### Example: Cooking Domain

```python
class CookingParser(DomainParser):
    def parse_requirements(self, recipe):
        # Extract explicit equipment
        # Infer implicit requirements
        # Parse parameters (temperature, time)
        pass

class CookingMatcher(CapabilityMatcher):
    def match(self, requirements, capabilities):
        # Match equipment
        # Check parameter compatibility
        # Apply cooking-specific rules
        pass
```

### Example: Manufacturing Domain

```python
class ManufacturingParser(DomainParser):
    def parse_requirements(self, okh_data):
        # Parse manufacturing processes
        # Extract tolerances and specifications
        # Map to standard processes
        pass

class ManufacturingMatcher(CapabilityMatcher):
    def match(self, requirements, capabilities):
        # Check process compatibility
        # Verify tolerances
        # Consider material constraints
        pass
```

## Data Flow

1. Input Processing
   ```
   Domain Input -> Parser -> Standardized Requirements
   ```

2. Capability Processing
   ```
   Capability Data -> Parser -> Standardized Capabilities
   ```

3. Matching Process
   ```
   Requirements + Capabilities -> Matcher -> Scored Matches
   ```

## Extension Points

The system can be extended in several ways:

1. **New Domains**
   - Implement DomainParser interface
   - Implement CapabilityMatcher interface
   - Add domain-specific taxonomies

2. **Enhanced Matching**
   - Add new matching algorithms
   - Implement custom scoring methods
   - Create specialized validators

3. **Additional Features**
   - Add new requirement types
   - Implement new capability attributes
   - Create custom validation rules

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - Parallel processing
   - Database integration

2. **Integration Features**
   - API endpoints
   - Event handling
   - External service connectors

3. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Match quality metrics
   - Usage statistics
   - Performance monitoring
