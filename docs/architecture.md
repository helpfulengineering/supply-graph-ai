# Open Matching Engine (OME)
 
## Overview

The Open Matching Engine (OME) is a flexible, domain-agnostic matching framework designed to solve complex requirements-to-capabilities mapping problems across various domains.

### Core Concept

At its heart, OME is a multi-stage, modular matching system that can progressively match requirements against capabilities using increasingly sophisticated techniques:

1. **Exact Matching**: Precise, direct comparisons
2. **Heuristic Matching**: Rule-based approximate matching
3. **NLP Matching**: Semantic similarity analysis
4. **AI/ML Matching**: Advanced machine learning inference

## Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Matching Layers**
   - Base abstract classes define the matching interface
   - Domain-specific implementations extend these base classes
   - Each layer is a separate, composable matching strategy

2. **Orchestration System**
   - Manages the entire matching pipeline
   - Handles module loading and configuration
   - Tracks system state and matching progress

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Support for YAML-based configuration
   - Dynamic module loading
   - Priority-based module execution

4. **Validation Framework**
   - Input validation
   - Constraint checking
   - Data consistency verification

5. **Scoring System**
   - Configurable scoring algorithms
   - Weighting mechanisms
   - Confidence calculations

6. **API Layer**
   - RESTful endpoints for matching requests
   - Async processing for long-running matches
   - Standardized response formats


### Base Classes and Interfaces

The system is built around several key abstractions:

```python
Requirement:
- Represents what is needed (e.g., equipment, processes)
- Contains parameters and constraints
- Domain specific implementations extend this, and include OpenKnowHow

Capability:
- Represents what is available
- Contains parameters and limitations
- Domain specific implementations extend this, and include OpenKnowWhere

DomainParser:
- Converts domain-specific input into standardized requirements
- Handles taxonomy mapping and validation

Orchestrator:
- Manages the matching pipeline
- Loads modules based on configuration
- Executes modules in priority order

MatchingModule:
- Abstract base class for domain-specific matching modules
- Defines the match() method
```

## Domain-Specific Implementation: Cooking Domain

### Motivation

We're developing the initial proof of concept in the cooking domain due to its:
- Structured yet flexible requirements
- Clear capability-to-requirement mapping
- Analogous complexity to manufacturing domains

### Example Use Case

**Recipe Matching Scenario**:
- Input: Rack of Lamb Recipe Requirements
- Capabilities: Available Kitchen Equipment
- Goal: Determine if the recipe can be prepared with existing equipment

## Configuration Example

```yaml
matching_modules:
  - name: exact_match
    type: exact
    domain: cooking
    priority: 10
    enabled: true
    config:
      strict_mode: true
  
  - name: heuristic_match
    type: heuristic
    domain: cooking
    priority: 50
    enabled: true
    config:
      similarity_threshold: 0.7
```

## Development Guidelines
