# Manufacturing Domain Implementation

## Overview

The manufacturing domain implementation focuses on matching hardware designs specified in OpenKnowHow (OKH) format with manufacturing capabilities documented in OpenKnowWhere (OKW) format. This domain demonstrates the full power of the Open Matching Engine's multi-stage matching approach.

## Domain Model

### Requirements (OKH Design)

A hardware design represents our requirements object in the manufacturing domain. Key components include:

```python
class OKHRequirement(BaseRequirement):
    design_files: List[DesignFile]          # CAD models, drawings, etc.
    manufacturing_files: List[ManufFile]     # G-code, tool paths, etc.
    bom: BillOfMaterials                    # Required materials and components
    tools: List[Tool]                       # Required tooling
    processes: List[Process]                # Required manufacturing processes
    standards: List[Standard]               # Required certifications/standards
```

### Capabilities (OKW Facility)

A manufacturing facility represents our capabilities object:

```python
class OKWCapability(BaseCapability):
    equipment: List[Equipment]         # Available machines and tools
    materials: List[Material]          # Available/supported materials
    processes: List[Process]          # Supported manufacturing processes
    certifications: List[Certification] # Facility certifications
    batch_size: BatchSizeRange        # Production volume capabilities
    quality_specs: QualitySpecs       # Tolerances and quality metrics
```

## Extraction Implementation

### OKH Design Extraction

The `OKHExtractor` handles parsing hardware design specifications:

```python
class OKHExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    """Extracts structured requirements from OKH manifests"""
    
    def extract_manufacturing_requirements(self) -> ManufacturingRequirements:
        """Extracts key manufacturing requirements from design files"""
        # Analyzes CAD files, G-code, etc. to determine:
        # - Required processes
        # - Material specifications
        # - Tolerance requirements
        # - Batch size needs
        
    def extract_quality_requirements(self) -> QualityRequirements:
        """Extracts quality and certification requirements"""
        # Identifies:
        # - Required standards compliance
        # - Quality control specifications
        # - Testing requirements
```

### OKW Capability Extraction

The `OKWExtractor` handles parsing facility capabilities:

```python
class OKWExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    """Extracts structured capabilities from OKW data"""
    
    def extract_facility_capabilities(self) -> FacilityCapabilities:
        """Extracts manufacturing capabilities from facility data"""
        # Maps:
        # - Available equipment to supported processes
        # - Material handling capabilities
        # - Quality certifications
        
    def extract_capacity_constraints(self) -> CapacityConstraints:
        """Determines facility constraints"""
        # Analyzes:
        # - Production volume limitations
        # - Material size constraints
        # - Equipment limitations
```

## Matching Implementation

### Exact Matching Layer

The exact matching layer handles precise matches of requirements to capabilities:

```python
class ManufacturingExactMatcher(BaseExactMatcher):
    """Performs exact matching for manufacturing requirements"""
    
    def match_processes(self, required: Process, available: Process) -> bool:
        """Checks if available processes exactly match requirements"""
        # Validates:
        # - Process type match
        # - Equipment specifications match
        # - Material compatibility
        
    def match_certifications(self, required: Certification, 
                           available: List[Certification]) -> bool:
        """Verifies certification requirements are met"""
        # Checks:
        # - Standard compliance
        # - Certification validity
        # - Testing capabilities
```

### Heuristic Matching Layer

The heuristic matcher handles common substitutions and alternatives:

```python
class ManufacturingHeuristicMatcher(BaseHeuristicMatcher):
    """Implements manufacturing-specific matching heuristics"""
    
    def find_process_alternatives(self, process: Process) -> List[Process]:
        """Identifies valid alternative manufacturing processes"""
        # Uses rules to find:
        # - Equivalent processes
        # - Compatible substitutes
        # - Process chains that achieve same result
        
    def evaluate_material_compatibility(self, design_material: Material,
                                     facility_materials: List[Material]) -> float:
        """Scores material compatibility"""
        # Considers:
        # - Material properties
        # - Grade compatibility 
        # - Processing requirements
```

### NLP Matching Layer

The NLP matching layer uses natural language processing to understand specifications:

```python
class ManufacturingNLPMatcher(BaseNLPMatcher):
    """Implements NLP-based matching for manufacturing"""
    
    def analyze_design_requirements(self, design_docs: str) -> DesignIntent:
        """Analyzes design documentation for requirements"""
        # Uses NLP to:
        # - Extract implicit requirements
        # - Understand design intent
        # - Identify critical features
        
    def match_capability_descriptions(self, requirement: str,
                                   capabilities: List[str]) -> List[Match]:
        """Matches requirements to capability descriptions"""
        # Uses semantic matching for:
        # - Equipment capabilities
        # - Process descriptions
        # - Material specifications
```

### AI/ML Matching Layer

The ML matching layer employs machine learning and LLMs for sophisticated analysis:

```python
class ManufacturingMLMatcher(BaseMLMatcher):
    """Implements ML-based matching for manufacturing"""
    
    def analyze_manufacturability(self, design: Design,
                               facility: Facility) -> ManufacturabilityAnalysis:
        """Analyzes overall manufacturability"""
        # Uses ML models to:
        # - Predict manufacturing challenges
        # - Estimate costs and time
        # - Suggest design modifications
        
    async def llm_enhanced_analysis(self, design_docs: str,
                                  facility_docs: str,
                                  previous_results: MatchResult) -> LLMAnalysis:
        """Uses LLMs to enhance matching analysis"""
        # Prompt template focuses on:
        # - Manufacturing constraints
        # - Process compatibility
        # - Design for manufacturing feedback
        
        # Returns analysis without modifying core matches
```

## Progressive Matching Pipeline

The matching process is managed by a dedicated runner that orchestrates multiple matching layers:

```python
class ManufacturingMatchRunner(BaseMatchRunner):
    """Orchestrates the progressive matching pipeline"""
    
    def __init__(self, target_confidence: float = 0.9):
        self.target_confidence = target_confidence
        self.matchers = [
            ManufacturingExactMatcher(),
            ManufacturingHeuristicMatcher(),
            ManufacturingNLPMatcher(),
            ManufacturingMLMatcher()
        ]
    
    def run_pipeline(self, design: OKHRequirement,
                    facility: OKWCapability) -> MatchResult:
        """Runs the matching pipeline until target confidence is reached"""
        result = MatchResult()
        
        for matcher in self.matchers:
            # Run current matching layer
            layer_result = matcher.match(design, facility)
            result.update(layer_result)
            
            # Check confidence thresholds
            if result.confidence >= self.target_confidence:
                break
                
            if matcher.is_confidence_ceiling(result):
                break
        
        return result
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. Standards Integration
   - Direct mapping to OKH and OKW schemas
   - Extensible property matching
   - Preservation of standards compliance

2. Matching Priorities
   - Critical requirements (safety, certifications)
   - Process capabilities
   - Material compatibility
   - Quality requirements
   - Production volume

3. Confidence Scoring
   - Weighted by requirement criticality
   - Influenced by certification status
   - Adjusted for material grade matches
   - Enhanced by LLM analysis
