# Cooking Domain Implementation

## Overview

The cooking domain serves as our initial proof-of-concept for the Open Matching Engine. It provides a familiar context with clear requirements-to-capabilities matching needs while maintaining enough complexity to validate our core abstractions.

## Domain Model

### Requirements (Recipe)

A recipe represents our requirements object in the cooking domain. Key components include:

```python
class RecipeRequirement(BaseRequirement):
    ingredients: List[Ingredient]
    equipment: List[Equipment]
    techniques: List[Technique]
    time_requirements: TimeConstraints
    temperature_requirements: Optional[TemperatureConstraints]
```

### Capabilities (Kitchen)

A kitchen represents our capabilities object, defining what's available for cooking:

```python
class KitchenCapability(BaseCapability):
    available_equipment: List[Equipment]
    available_techniques: List[Technique]
    temperature_range: TemperatureRange
    workspace_constraints: WorkspaceConstraints
```

## Extraction Implementation

### Recipe Extraction

The `RecipeExtractor` extends our base extraction framework to handle various recipe input formats:

```python
class RecipeExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    """Extracts structured recipe requirements from various input formats"""
    
    def extract_equipment(self) -> List[Equipment]:
        """Identifies required equipment from recipe text"""
        # Implementation details
        
    def extract_techniques(self) -> List[Technique]:
        """Identifies required cooking techniques"""
        # Implementation details
```

Key Considerations:
- Handling implicit requirements (e.g., "sauté" implies need for a pan)
- Normalizing equipment names and techniques
- Extracting timing and temperature constraints

### Kitchen Capability Extraction

The `KitchenExtractor` handles parsing kitchen inventory and capabilities:

```python
class KitchenExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    """Extracts structured kitchen capabilities"""
    
    def extract_equipment(self) -> List[Equipment]:
        """Catalogs available kitchen equipment"""
        # Implementation details
        
    def extract_techniques(self) -> List[Technique]:
        """Determines available cooking techniques"""
        # Implementation details
```

## Matching Implementation

### Exact Matching

The exact matching layer handles precise equipment and technique matches:

```python
class CookingExactMatcher(BaseExactMatcher):
    """Performs exact matching for cooking requirements"""
    
    def match_equipment(self, required: Equipment, available: Equipment) -> bool:
        """Checks if available equipment exactly matches requirements"""
        # Implementation details
```

### Heuristic Matching

The heuristic matcher handles common substitutions and technique alternatives:

```python
class CookingHeuristicMatcher(BaseHeuristicMatcher):
    """Implements cooking-specific matching heuristics"""
    
    def find_equipment_substitutes(self, equipment: Equipment) -> List[Equipment]:
        """Identifies valid equipment substitutions"""
        # Implementation details
```

### NLP Matching

The NLP matching layer uses natural language processing to understand semantic relationships and context:

```python
class CookingNLPMatcher(BaseNLPMatcher):
    """Implements NLP-based matching for cooking requirements"""
    
    def analyze_technique_context(self, technique: str, instruction_context: str) -> TechniqueAnalysis:
        """Analyzes technique requirements based on surrounding context"""
        # Uses NLP to understand modifiers and requirements
        # E.g., "gently sauté" vs "high-heat sauté"
        
    def extract_implicit_requirements(self, recipe_text: str) -> List[ImplicitRequirement]:
        """Identifies requirements implied by recipe language"""
        # Uses NLP to find hidden requirements
        # E.g., "until golden brown" implies visual monitoring
        
    def match_equipment_descriptions(self, required: EquipmentDesc, available: List[EquipmentDesc]) -> List[Match]:
        """Matches equipment based on natural language descriptions"""
        # Semantic matching of equipment capabilities
        # Handles variations in terminology and descriptions
```

Key NLP Features:
- Contextual understanding of cooking instructions
- Semantic similarity for equipment matching
- Named entity recognition for ingredients and tools
- Temporal understanding for timing requirements

### AI/ML Matching

The ML matching layer employs machine learning models for sophisticated pattern recognition and matching:

```python
class CookingMLMatcher(BaseMLMatcher):
    """Implements ML-based matching for cooking requirements"""
    
    def predict_technique_success(self, technique: Technique, 
                                available_equipment: List[Equipment]) -> SuccessPrediction:
        """Predicts likelihood of successful technique execution"""
        # Uses ML models to evaluate technique feasibility
        # Considers equipment capabilities and constraints
        
    def recommend_substitutions(self, required: Equipment,
                              available: List[Equipment]) -> List[WeightedSubstitution]:
        """Suggests equipment substitutions using ML models"""
        # Generates ranked substitution recommendations
        # Based on historical success patterns
        
    def analyze_recipe_complexity(self, recipe: Recipe,
                                kitchen: Kitchen) -> ComplexityAnalysis:
        """Analyzes overall recipe feasibility"""
        # Uses ML to assess complete recipe requirements
        # Considers kitchen capabilities holistically
```

ML Components:

Traditional ML Models

1. Equipment Substitution Model
   - Trained on successful substitution patterns
   - Considers multiple equipment properties
   - Weighted feature importance


2. Technique Success Predictor
   - Evaluates technique feasibility
   - Considers equipment combinations
   - Accounts for kitchen constraints

3. Recipe Complexity Analyzer
   - Holistic recipe assessment
   - Resource requirement prediction
   - Skill level estimation


LLM Integration

1. Pattern Recognition
   - Identifies complex linguistic patterns
   - Recognizes implicit requirements
   - Understands contextual modifications


2. Analysis Augmentation
   - Validates heuristic matching results
   - Suggests potential edge cases
   - Identifies missing context


3. Usage Guidelines
   - LLM analysis supplements but doesn't replace other matching methods
   - Results are used to enhance confidence scoring
   - Hallucination risk is mitigated by cross-referencing with other layers


4. Confidence Integration
    LLM analysis results are weighted based on:
   - Consistency with other layer results
   - Prompt specificity and constraint adherence
   - Response coherence metrics

## Progressive Matching Pipeline

The matching process is managed by a dedicated runner that orchestrates multiple matching layers in increasing sophistication:

```python
class CookingMatchRunner(BaseMatchRunner):
    """Orchestrates the progressive matching pipeline for cooking domain"""
    
    def __init__(self, target_confidence: float = 0.9):
        self.target_confidence = target_confidence
        self.matchers = [
            CookingExactMatcher(),      # Fast, high-confidence matches
            CookingHeuristicMatcher(),  # Rule-based approximations
            CookingNLPMatcher(),        # Natural language understanding
            CookingMLMatcher()          # ML-based advanced matching
        ]
    
    def run_pipeline(self, requirements: RecipeRequirement,
                    capabilities: KitchenCapability) -> MatchResult:
        """Runs the matching pipeline until target confidence is reached"""
        result = MatchResult()
        
        for matcher in self.matchers:
            # Run current matching layer
            layer_result = matcher.match(requirements, capabilities)
            result.update(layer_result)
            
            # Check if we've reached target confidence
            if result.confidence >= self.target_confidence:
                break
                
            # Check if we've reached maximum possible confidence
            if matcher.is_confidence_ceiling(result):
                break
        
        return result
```

Key Features:
1. Progressive Refinement
   - Starts with simple, fast matching
   - Proceeds to more sophisticated methods as needed
   - Stops when confidence threshold is met

2. Confidence Tracking
   - Each layer contributes to overall confidence
   - Confidence ceiling detection prevents unnecessary processing
   - Weighted combination of layer results

3. Performance Optimization
   - Fast paths for high-confidence matches
   - Caching of intermediate results
   - Parallel processing where applicable

## Design Decisions

### Equipment Normalization

We maintain a hierarchical equipment taxonomy to handle variations:

```yaml
cooking_vessels:
  - pan:
      - frying_pan
      - saute_pan
      - saucepan
  - pot:
      - stockpot
      - dutch_oven
```

### Technique Mapping

Techniques are mapped to their required equipment and constraints:

```python
TECHNIQUE_REQUIREMENTS = {
    'saute': {
        'equipment': ['pan'],
        'temperature_range': (medium_heat, high_heat),
        'workspace': 'stovetop'
    }
}
```

## Known Challenges

1. **Implicit Requirements**
   - Many recipes assume basic equipment
   - Some techniques imply specific equipment needs
   - Solution: Maintain comprehensive technique-to-equipment mapping

2. **Substitutions**
   - Equipment can often be substituted
   - Techniques may have alternative approaches
   - Solution: Implement flexible heuristic matching rules

3. **Ambiguous Specifications**
   - Recipe instructions may be vague
   - Equipment specifications might be incomplete
   - Solution: Conservative matching with confidence scoring

## Example Implementation

### Basic Recipe Matching

```python
# Example of how a recipe requirement is matched against kitchen capabilities
from src.domains.cooking.matchers import CookingExactMatcher
from src.domains.cooking.extractors import RecipeExtractor, KitchenExtractor

def match_recipe_to_kitchen(recipe_text: str, kitchen_inventory: dict):
    # Extract recipe requirements
    recipe_extractor = RecipeExtractor(recipe_text)
    requirements = recipe_extractor.extract()
    
    # Extract kitchen capabilities
    kitchen_extractor = KitchenExtractor(kitchen_inventory)
    capabilities = kitchen_extractor.extract()
    
    # Perform matching
    matcher = CookingExactMatcher()
    match_result = matcher.match(requirements, capabilities)
    
    return match_result
```

## Testing Guidelines
