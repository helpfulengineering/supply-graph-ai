# Open Matching Engine (OME) Overview

## Problem Space

### Core Challenge
In the world of distributed manufacturing and open hardware, there's a fundamental challenge: how do we match hardware designs with production capabilities? Specifically, given a hardware design specified in OpenKnowHow (OKH) format, how do we find all facilities in a region whose capabilities (specified in OpenKnowWhere format) can successfully produce that design?

This matching problem is complex due to several factors:

#### **Multiple Requirements**
   - Materials specifications
   - Tool requirements
   - Process requirements
   - Quality standards
   - Production volumes
   - Time constraints

#### **Varying Detail Levels**
   - Some specifications are exact and inflexible
   - Others are approximate or have alternatives
   - Specifications may be incomplete or ambiguous
   - Different contexts require different precision

#### **Complex Dependencies**
   - Multi-stage manufacturing processes
   - Material sourcing dependencies
   - Time-based constraints
   - Resource availability
   - Facility capability matching

#### **Scale Considerations**
   - Large number of potential facilities
   - Multiple possible production paths
   - Various optimization criteria
   - Network-wide resource allocation

## Solution Approach

The OME addresses these challenges through a modular, multi-stage approach:

### 1. Component Architecture

OME is built as four independent but interoperable components:

- **OME.extraction**: Converts unstructured input into normalized formats
- **OME.analysis**: Identifies requirements and capabilities
- **OME.matching**: Generates and validates manufacturing solutions
- **OME.routing**: Optimizes material and facility routing

Each component can be used independently or as part of an integrated pipeline.

### 2. Supply Trees

At the core of OME is the Supply Tree data structure, which:

- Represents complete manufacturing solutions
- Maps requirements to facility capabilities
- Supports different validation contexts
- Manages material and process requirements
- Enables solution optimization and matching

### 3. Progressive Processing

OME uses increasingly sophisticated processing stages:

#### **Exact Matching**
   - Direct requirement-to-capability mapping
   - Precise specification matching
   - Unambiguous validation

#### **Heuristic Matching**
   - Rule-based approximations
   - Known substitutions
   - Domain-specific shortcuts

#### **NLP Matching**
   - Natural language understanding
   - Semantic similarity
   - Context interpretation

#### **AI/ML Matching**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Historical learning
   - Complex substitutions

## Use Cases

### 1. Design-to-Manufacturing
A designer creates an open hardware design and needs to:
- Find capable manufacturers
- Validate production feasibility
- Compare production options
- Optimize for cost/time/quality

```python
# Example: Find manufacturers for a design
results = ome.find_manufacturers(
    design_file="open-hardware-design.okh",
    region="North America",
    quantity=1000,
    optimize_for="cost"
)
```

### 2. Capability Discovery
A manufacturer wants to:
- Discover compatible designs
- Assess production capabilities
- Identify opportunity gaps
- Optimize resource utilization

```python
# Example: Find matching designs for a facility
matches = ome.find_matching_designs(
    facility_data="factory-capabilities.okw",
    design_database="open-hardware-db",
    min_confidence=0.8
)
```

### 3. Network Optimization
A distributed manufacturing network needs to:
- Route designs to optimal producers
- Balance network load
- Manage resource allocation
- Coordinate multi-facility production

```python
# Example: Optimize production across network
solution = ome.optimize_network(
    design="product-spec.okh",
    network="manufacturing-network.json",
    constraints={
        "max_distance": "500km",
        "max_time": "14d"
    }
)
```

### 4. Quality Validation
Quality assurance teams need to:
- Validate production capabilities
- Verify standard compliance
- Assess quality requirements
- Monitor production consistency

```python
# Example: Validate production quality
validation = ome.validate_production(
    design="medical-device.okh",
    facility="factory.okw",
    context="medical_devices",
    standards=["ISO_13485"]
)
```

## Domain Examples

### Manufacturing Domain
```python
# Manufacturing example
manufacturing_solution = ome.process(
    input_data="hardware-design.okh",
    domain="manufacturing",
    requirements={
        "quantity": 1000,
        "deadline": "2024-03-01",
        "quality_standard": "ISO_9001"
    }
)
```

### Cooking Domain (Proof of Concept)
```python
# Cooking example
recipe_solution = ome.process(
    input_data="recipe.json",
    domain="cooking",
    requirements={
        "servings": 4,
        "max_prep_time": "2h",
        "skill_level": "intermediate"
    }
)
```
