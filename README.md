# Open Matching Engine (OME)

## Overview

The Open Matching Engine (OME) is a flexible, domain-agnostic framework designed to solve complex requirements-to-capabilities matching problems across various domains.

### Project Vision

Our goal is to create a robust, extensible system that can:
- Parse unstructured or semi-structured input
- Extract meaningful, structured information
- Match requirements against available capabilities
- Support multiple domains with a consistent architectural approach

## Key Features

- **Multi-Stage Processing**
  - Advanced extraction pipeline
  - Configurable matching modules
  - Sophisticated uncertainty handling

- **Domain Flexibility**
  - Proof of concept in cooking domain
  - Designed with manufacturing applications in mind
  - Easily extensible to new domains

- **Comprehensive Metadata**
  - Detailed extraction and matching quality assessments
  - Confidence scoring
  - Explicit handling of partial and ambiguous results

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Extraction Layer**
   - Converts unstructured input to structured data
   - Multi-stage parsing and validation
   - Quality assessment and uncertainty tracking

2. **Matching Layer**
   - Modular matching modules
   - Supports exact, heuristic, NLP, and ML matching strategies
   - Configurable priority and processing

3. **Orchestration System**
   - Manages extraction and matching pipelines
   - Dynamic module loading
   - Comprehensive state tracking

## Current Development Status

- **Phase**: Proof of Concept
- **Primary Domain**: Cooking
- **Target Domain**: Manufacturing

## Roadmap

1. Complete core framework implementation
2. Develop domain-specific extraction modules
3. Implement advanced matching strategies
4. Expand to manufacturing domain
5. Create comprehensive test suite
