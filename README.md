# Open Matching Engine (OME)

## Overview

The Open Matching Engine (OME) is a flexible, domain-agnostic framework designed to solve complex requirements-to-capabilities matching problems across various domains.

## Problem Space

The Open Matching Engine (OME) addresses a critical challenge in distributed manufacturing and open hardware: matching hardware designs with production capabilities. The core problem can be described as follows:

### Core Challenge

Given a hardware design specified in OpenKnowHow (OKH) format, find all facilities in a region whose capabilities (specified in OpenKnowWhere format) can successfully produce that design. This matching problem is complex due to:

- Multiple interdependent requirements (materials, tools, processes)
- Varying levels of specification detail
- Potential for partial matches or alternative production methods
- Need for confidence scoring in matches
- Scale of potential facility networks

### Example Use Cases

1. A designer creates an open hardware design and wants to find local manufacturers
2. A manufacturer wants to discover which open hardware designs they're capable of producing
3. A distributed manufacturing network wants to automatically route designs to optimal producers

### Project Vision

Our goal is to create a robust, extensible system that can:
- Parse unstructured or semi-structured input
- Extract meaningful, structured information
- Match requirements against available capabilities
- Support multiple domains with a consistent architectural approach

## Key Features

- **Multi-Stage Processing**
  - Advanced extraction pipeline
  - Configurable matching modules
  - Sophisticated uncertainty handling

- **Domain Flexibility**
  - Proof of concept in cooking domain
  - Designed with manufacturing applications in mind
  - Easily extensible to new domains

- **Comprehensive Metadata**
  - Detailed extraction and matching quality assessments
  - Confidence scoring
  - Explicit handling of partial and ambiguous results

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Matching Layers**
   - Base abstract classes define the matching interface
   - Domain-specific implementations extend these base classes
   - Each layer is a separate, composable matching strategy

2. **Orchestration System**
   - Manages the entire matching pipeline
   - Handles module loading and configuration
   - Tracks system state and matching progress

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Support for YAML-based configuration
   - Dynamic module loading
   - Priority-based module execution

4. **Validation Framework**
   - Input validation
   - Constraint checking
   - Data consistency verification

5. **Scoring System**
   - Configurable scoring algorithms
   - Weighting mechanisms
   - Confidence calculations

6. **API Layer**
   - RESTful endpoints for matching requests
   - Async processing for long-running matches
   - Standardized response formats


### Data Flow

```
[Input: OKH/OKW Documents] → [Extraction] → [Validation] → [Matching Pipeline] → [Results]
                                                            ↓
                                         [Exact] → [Heuristic] → [NLP] → [ML]
```
