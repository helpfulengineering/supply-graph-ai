Comprehensive tests for NLP Matching Layer

This module provides comprehensive test coverage for the NLP matching layer,
following TDD principles. Tests cover semantic similarity, entity recognition,
synonym detection, and integration with the matching service.

Test Categories:
- Unit tests for NLPMatcher class
- Integration tests with matching service
- Performance tests for semantic similarity
- Error handling and edge cases
- Domain-specific matching scenarios
