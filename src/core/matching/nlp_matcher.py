NLP Matching Layer Implementation

This module implements the NLP Matching layer for the Open Matching Engine (OME).
It provides natural language processing-based matching for semantic understanding
between requirements and capabilities.

This layer is part of the 4-layer matching architecture and inherits from
BaseMatchingLayer to ensure consistent interfaces and error handling.

    NLP matching layer using natural language processing for semantic understanding.
    
    This layer provides semantic matching between requirements and capabilities
    using natural language processing techniques. It can understand synonyms,
    related terms, and semantic relationships that direct and heuristic matching
    might miss.
    
    Features:
    - Semantic similarity matching
    - Synonym and related term detection
    - Context-aware matching
    - Configurable similarity thresholds
    - Comprehensive metadata tracking
    
    Note: This is a placeholder implementation. Full NLP integration will be
    implemented in future phases with proper NLP libraries and models.
