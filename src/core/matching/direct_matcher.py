Direct Matching Layer Implementation

This module implements the Direct Matching layer for the Open Matching Engine (OME).
It provides exact, case-insensitive string matching with detailed metadata tracking
and confidence scoring for both cooking and manufacturing domains.

This layer is part of the 4-layer matching architecture and inherits from
BaseMatchingLayer to ensure consistent interfaces and error handling.
