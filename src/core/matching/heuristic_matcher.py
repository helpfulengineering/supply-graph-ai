Heuristic Matching Layer Implementation

This module implements the Heuristic Matching layer for the Open Matching Engine (OME).
It provides rule-based matching using domain knowledge stored in capability rules.

This layer is part of the 4-layer matching architecture and inherits from
BaseMatchingLayer to ensure consistent interfaces and error handling.
