"""
Cleanup/optimization utilities for OKH project directories.

Goals (initial version):
- Remove unmodified documentation stubs created by the scaffold generator
- Remove empty directories left after users delete placeholder files

Design notes:
- Stub detection is content-based by regenerating known stub templates from
  ScaffoldService and comparing exact file contents. This avoids accidental
  deletion of user-modified files.
- Operations support dry-run to preview changes safely.
